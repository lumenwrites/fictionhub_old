      <p> New to writing?  I recommend to start by reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/33oar9/ot_ask_lexi_1_how_to_start_writing/">this post</a>, and then watching  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTT-Xb7kSZWWdgWGER_CroAif3-BxYRJH">  an awesome writing course</a>  by Brandon Sanderson.</p>

      <p><a href="/story/story/">Here</a> you can read a series of articles on story structure(you can also learn about it from 
<a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Screenwriting-for-Hollywood-Audiobook/B002UZMN8A/">
  this
</a> amazing lecture.).</p>

      <p>And <a href="http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing">this</a> is a great guide on writing intelligent characters.</p>
